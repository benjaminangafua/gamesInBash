2. This system      allows the users     to draw analog and digital circuits     and simulate them. The users        have a facility to drag and drop components from the left pane onto the schematic grid on the right pane. 
3. The components on the grid are connected using wires. The circuit can then be simulated using the different simulation parameters (DC Solver, DC Sweep, Transient analysis, and AC analysis). 
4. The basic ERC check enables the users to find out errors if any. 

5. The size of the schematic grid can be changed from A1 to A5 paper sizes along with portrait and landscape modes. 



6. The users can also print the circuit or save it in pdf format for documentation purposes. A demo is shown below.
